-- do a better check than artist + song
	I mean what about artists that have multiple versions of one song
	All versions will be excluded even though only one may be in 3_filed

	For example, if there are multiple of the same song for an artist,
	then the check should include the album comparison

-- sort all artists that are unique after the change into 'checked'
-- for existing artists, list albums that are unique
-- for existing albums, list songs that are unique

-- Rich Mullins - Brother's Keeper - Title track was excluded. Are all title tracks excluded?
